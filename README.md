# vaccumcleaner-temProj
Term project for cos472/672
This is a simple intelligent agent program that is based on the vaccum cleaner world problem. This programs works by asking the user to enter in 
how many rooms they want to create. This is done by creating a nxn grid or matrix. The user is then asked how many rooms should be dirty. The
dirty rooms are then randomly assigned and the program listes the goal state, initial state, transition model, path cost and move cost. The program 
then proceeds to clean each room at a time by finding an optimal path to that room and then printing out the moves that were made along with the cost.
When all rooms are clean the goal state is achieved and the total cost is printed.
